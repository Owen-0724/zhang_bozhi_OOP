# Earbud Gallery OOP Project

This project creates a simple image gallery of earbuds where images can be dynamically added and displayed. The images scale smoothly on hover and are centered within the gallery container. The gallery is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Features
- **Dynamic Image Display**: Images are added to the gallery dynamically using JavaScript.
- **Hover Effect**: When hovering over the image, it smoothly scales up using CSS transitions.
- **Click Event**: The images trigger a color-changing effect when clicked (using the `Taggedearbud` class).
